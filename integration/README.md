# Integration Tests

End-to-end integration tests that deploy and spend Runar contracts on a real Bitcoin node. Tests are organized by language (Go, TypeScript, Rust, Python, Ruby, Zig) — each suite uses its own compiler and SDK for deployment/calling.

Two node backends are supported:

- **SV Node** — Bitcoin SV node with built-in wallet (default)
- **Teranode** — BSV's microservices-based node implementation

## Quick Start

### SV Node

```bash
# Start node, run tests, stop node
pnpm integration:svnode:run

# Or step by step:
pnpm integration:svnode:start
pnpm integration:go          # Go tests
pnpm integration:ts          # TypeScript tests
pnpm integration:svnode:stop
pnpm integration:svnode:clean    # remove all data
```

### Teranode

```bash
# Start node, run tests, stop node (clean start)
pnpm integration:teranode:run

# Or step by step:
pnpm integration:teranode:start   # starts Docker services + mines 10101 blocks
pnpm integration:teranode
pnpm integration:teranode:stop
pnpm integration:teranode:clean   # remove all data + volumes
```

## Test Suites

### Go (`integration/go/`)

Full-featured tests using the Go compiler and SDK. Includes raw transaction construction for contracts that require ECDSA signatures in the unlocking script.

```bash
cd integration/go && go test -tags integration -v -timeout 600s
```

### TypeScript (`integration/ts/`)

Tests using the TypeScript compiler and SDK. All contracts use the SDK's `Deploy` + `Call` path.

```bash
cd integration/ts && npx vitest run
```

### Rust (`integration/rust/`)

Tests using the Rust compiler and SDK. All contracts use the SDK's Deploy + Call path.

```bash
cd integration/rust && cargo test --release -- --ignored
```

### Python (`integration/python/`)

Tests using the Python compiler and SDK. Requires `bsv-sdk` pip package for real ECDSA signing.

```bash
cd integration/python
python3.13 -m venv .venv                # Python 3.13 (3.14 has coincurve build issues)
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=../../compilers/python:../../packages/runar-py .venv/bin/pytest -v
```

### Run All Suites

```bash
# Run all suites (node must be running)
pnpm integration:all

# Start node, run all, stop node
pnpm integration:all:run
```

## Test-only contracts (`integration/contracts/`)

Non-tutorial fixtures for feature / construct coverage live under
`integration/contracts/` — **not** under `examples/`. See
`integration/contracts/README.md` and `coverage-matrix.json`.

Phase A (TS + Go regtest):

| Feature | Contract | Require |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Branch-merged locals (Palmer-1) | `constructs/BranchMergedLocals.runar.ts` | deploy+spend+state |
| Cond multi-field write (#99) | `constructs/CondWriteMultiField.runar.ts` | deploy+spend+state |
| Conditional `addDataOutput` | `constructs/ConditionalDataOutput.runar.ts` | deploy+spend+state |
| 1-byte ByteString state (OP_N) | `constructs/StateByteString1B.runar.ts` | deploy+spend+state |
| `addRawOutput` | `outputs/RawOutput.runar.ts` | deploy+spend+output shape |
| `checkMultiSig` 2-of-3 | `crypto/MultiSig2of3.runar.ts` | deploy+spend |

```bash
node integration/contracts/check-matrix.mjs
```

[†] **Go is the only tier that SPENDS the two post-quantum wallets.**
These two rows used to read "Deploy + Spend" for TS / Rust / Python /
Ruby / Zig as well. That was wrong, and it was wrong in the most
dangerous direction: it claimed on-chain verification of a 19 KB WOTS+
and a 188 KB SLH-DSA locking script from six tiers that never executed
one. Only `integration/go/wots_test.go` (`TestWOTS_ValidSpend`) and
`integration/go/slhdsa_test.go` build the two-pass unlocking script —
a real ECDSA signature over the real spending input, then a real WOTS+ /
SLH-DSA signature over those signature bytes — and broadcast it to the
node (`AssertTxAccepted`, plus `AssertTxRejected` legs). The peer suites
say so themselves in their own comments ("full spend requires raw tx
construction … covered by the Go integration test"); the table simply
did not.

**Deploying is not executing.** A deploy broadcasts a tx whose OUTPUT
carries the locking script; the node never runs those bytes. Only a
spend does. So for these two contracts the six non-Go rows prove the
artifact compiles, funds, and confirms — not that the post-quantum
verifier accepts a valid signature or rejects a forged one.

What each non-Go tier does cover: deploy + UTXO confirmation, and (Java)
that the artifact is bit-for-bit identical to the TS-sourced one,
including the 188 KB SLH-DSA script. Raising any of these rows to
"Deploy + Spend" needs a tier-side SLH-DSA / WOTS+ keygen + sign plus
raw two-pass unlocking-script construction, mirroring the Go tests. For
Java specifically that means either (a) a Java-side FIPS 205
implementation (BouncyCastle ships SPHINCS+, but its parameter sets are
the round-3 candidate, not FIPS 205 SLH-DSA — direct substitution would
diverge from the Bitcoin Script verifier the Rúnar codegen targets), or
(b) shelling out to one of the other SDKs to generate signature bytes
the Java test then embeds into a tx.

The fixture-level record of this is
`conformance/witnesses/coverage-ledger.json`, where `post-quantum-wallet`
and `sphincs-wallet` carry `kind: "integration"` pointing at the two **Go**
test paths — with the byte-identity check that makes the claim mean
something (both fixtures' `expected-script.hex` reproduced exactly by the
source those tests compile, 19,594 and 188,609 bytes, in both fold modes).

## Node Setup Details

### SV Node

Uses the `bitcoinsv/bitcoin-sv:latest` Docker image. A single container runs the full node in regtest mode with:

- `genesisactivationheight=1` — post-Genesis rules from block 1
- `maxscriptsizepolicy=0` / `maxscriptnumlengthpolicy=0` — unlimited script sizes
- Built-in wallet for `sendtoaddress` funding

RPC: `http://localhost:18332` (user: `bitcoin`, pass: `bitcoin`)

### Teranode

Uses `ghcr.io/bsv-blockchain/teranode:v0.13.2` with 10+ microservices in Docker Compose:

- blockchain, validator, blockassembly, blockvalidation, subtreevalidation, propagation, rpc, asset, peer
- Infrastructure: PostgreSQL, Aerospike, Kafka (Redpanda)

Key differences from SV Node:

| Feature | SV Node | Teranode |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Genesis activation | Height 1 (configurable) | Height 10000 (hardcoded in go-chaincfg) |
| Wallet | Built-in (`sendtoaddress`) | None — uses raw coinbase UTXOs |
| `getrawtransaction` verbose | `true` (bool) | `1` (int) |
| `getrawtransaction` value | BTC (e.g. 50.0) | Satoshis (e.g. 5000000000) |
| `getblock` tx list | Populated | Empty (code commented out) |
| Block format | Standard | Extended (extra varint fields + subtree hashes) |

Because Teranode's Genesis activation is hardcoded at height 10000 for regtest, the `teranode.sh start` script pre-mines 10101 blocks (10000 for Genesis + 101 for coinbase maturity). This takes ~5 minutes on first start. Subsequent `start` commands (without `clean`) skip mining if blocks already exist.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NODE_TYPE` | `svnode` | Node backend: `svnode` or `teranode` |
| `RPC_URL` | auto | Override RPC endpoint URL |
| `RPC_USER` | `bitcoin` | RPC username |
| `RPC_PASS` | `bitcoin` | RPC password |

## Troubleshooting

**UTXO_SPENT errors**: Run `./teranode.sh clean && ./teranode.sh start` to reset all state. The coinbase UTXO counter resets each test run but Teranode remembers spent UTXOs.

**RPC timeout during mining**: The Teranode RPC timeout is set to 600s in `settings_local.conf`. The Go HTTP client also uses a 10-minute timeout.

**Tests pass on SV Node but fail on Teranode**: Check that the 10101 blocks were mined (Genesis activation). Run `./teranode.sh getblockchaininfo` to verify the block height.
